            <p>
                PAYAD is known as the Pilipino-American Youth Association of
                Delaware. We are a youth/young adult organization that enjoys
                exploring Filipino and American culture. We realized how rich
                and multicultural our world is today. The American culture and
                the traditions from our homeland, the Philippines, had a major
                impact on our Fil-Am identity. We are constantly inspiredand
                express ourselves through different art forms. We continue to
                pay tribute to past and present generations through music,
                dance, song, and by supporting communities that have shaped who
                we are.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                PAYAD was started when our current president, Michelle Rana, and
                her friend, Justine Alba, decided to resurrect it back in 2011.
                The original PAYAD started back in the early 2000s. The vision
                back then was just to get a group of young people to hang out
                and meet new people of their age with similar backgrounds. It
                was realized that there were other youth groups out there but
                wanted to set it apart by focusing on a different mission
                statement: To bring and encourage the youth of Delaware together
                to reinforce a positive perception of the Filipino American
                identity by celebrating our culture and heritage. It has
                eventually evolved to what it is today. A group of passionate,
                hard working individuals who give their spare time serving the
                community, inspiring people and celebrating their
                Filipino-American identity. PAYAD or otherwise known as the
                group with the “sticks”.
